Composite:  Maximum reflectivity in vertical volume above gauge:
Error handling: if value is -99900.0 then we will assume no rain fall 
	( composite reflectivity is the maximum of the dbz 
		[ dbz is proportional to log_10(z/z_0) where z is the measured reflectivity and z_0 is the reflectivity or a 1mm diameter drop of water in a 1m^3 volume ])
	-99900.0 means that ( echo below signal-to-noise threshold of radar.  In other words, the true value could be anywhere between -14 and -inf, but we don't know. ) so its < -14 which means z is really really small compared to z_0

Composite == -99900.0 && expected != 0.0
